# Welcome!

Welcome to TaskBridge, the app that makes it easy to keep your Apple Notes and Reminders synchronised with cloud
services such as [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com) and CalDAV.

This guide will help you quickly get started with TaskBrdige and make the most out of it! But first...

# Disclaimer

Although every care has been taken when developing TaskBridge, there are two **important** things you should be aware of:

1. TaskBridge is an app in very early development. It has been tested in a limited number of scenarios on a limited number
of machines. Therefore, your mileage may vary.
2. Unfortunately, the way that Apple Notes and Reminders are built makes them quite difficult to interact with programmatically.
This means that, at any point, Apple may decide to change how Notes and Reminders work, or disable programmatic interation 
entirely. This means that TaskBridge can stop working without any prior notice!
